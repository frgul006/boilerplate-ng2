                <h3>Holy Grail Layout</h3>

                <p>
                    The Holy Grail Layout is a classic CSS problem with various solutions presented over time. If you’re unfamiliar with the history of the Holy Grail layout, this A List Apart article offers a pretty good summary and links to a few of the more well-known solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, the Holy Grail Layout is a page with a header, footer, and three columns. The center column contains the main content, and the left and right columns contain supplemental content like ads or navigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most CSS solutions to this problem aim to meet a few goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        They should have a fluid center with fixed-width sidebars.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The center column (main content) should appear first in the HTML source.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All columns should be the same height, regardless of which column is actually the tallest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They should require minimal markup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The footer should "stick" to the bottom of the page when content is sparse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, because of the nature of these goals and the original limitations of CSS, none of the classic solutions to this problem were ever able to satisfy all of them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    <a href="../3/index.html">Continue</a>
                </h3>
            </div>
